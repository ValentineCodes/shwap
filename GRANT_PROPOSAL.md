# Scaffold-ETH-Mobile: Mobile dApp Starter Kit for Ethereum and EVM-Compatible Chains

### Project Overview

**Scaffold-ETH-Mobile** is an open-source, up-to-date starter kit designed to streamline the development of mobile decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It provides developers with essential tools such as a built-in wallet, contract debugger, and custom hooks, simplifying the process of building secure, mobile-first dApps. Scaffold-ETH-Mobile integrates Hardhat for smart contract development and React Native for mobile application development, making it easier for developers to build on-the-go dApps with full EVM compatibility.

### Mission Statement

Our mission is to enhance the mobile development ecosystem within the Ethereum and EVM-compatible space, focusing on improving the developer experience. Scaffold-ETH-Mobile empowers developers to quickly and efficiently build mobile-first decentralized applications that prioritize usability, scalability, and security.

### Problem Statement

As the decentralized ecosystem grows, the demand for high-quality mobile dApps increases. However, current tools for developing mobile dApps are fragmented and inefficient, especially on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Developers face challenges managing smart contracts, building user-friendly interfaces, and ensuring wallet security‚Äîall on mobile platforms. This lack of streamlined solutions limits the speed and quality of mobile dApp development and adoption.

### Proposed Solution

**Scaffold-ETH-Mobile** offers a comprehensive mobile-first development environment tailored to Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains. By integrating essential development tools and features, it simplifies the mobile dApp development process:

üßë‚Äçüíª **Contract Debugger:** View contract details such as addresses, balances, variables, and functions. Scaffold-ETH-Mobile allows real-time interaction with smart contracts to make development faster and more efficient.

‚úÖ **Contract Hot Reload:** Automatically updates the mobile frontend to reflect real-time changes in deployed smart contracts, reducing development time and friction.

ü™ù **Custom Hooks:** A collection of React hooks with TypeScript autocompletion, designed to simplify interactions with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible smart contracts, improving developer productivity.

üß± **Web3 Components:** Pre-built components to quickly assemble mobile dApp frontends, enabling developers to focus on functionality instead of spending time building from scratch.

By providing these tools, Scaffold-ETH-Mobile drastically reduces the time and effort required to build mobile dApps, making development more accessible to both new and experienced developers.

### Project Roadmap

**Phase 1: Core Development (Completed)**

- Implemented in-built wallet, contract hot reload, contract debugger, and custom hooks.

**Phase 2: Community Testing & Feedback (Next 3-6 months)**

- Gather feedback from early users to refine and optimize features.
- Enhance wallet functionality for ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 token support.
- Expand integration with additional development tools.

**Phase 3: Feature Expansion (6-12 months)**

- Introduce advanced debugging features and analytics.
- Build additional components for complex mobile dApp frontends.
- Extend support for Layer 2 solutions and non-EVM chains.
